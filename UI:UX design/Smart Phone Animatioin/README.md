# Introduction
Hi, this is an adobe xd project I created for a student club. It took me around 50 hours for making this plus countless hours for discussion...


I was using figima before, and this project was where I mainly developed my adobe xd skills.

## Reason why it is not catagorised
* The pages was mainly organised via visal presentation.
* I'm the only stuff maintaning this and it doesn't matter in this project.
